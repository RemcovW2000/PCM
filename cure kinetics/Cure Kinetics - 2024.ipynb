    "### As it was explained during the lectures, a significant part of research in composites manufacturing is involved in analyzing curing processes of thermoset polymers.Thermoset resins, such as epoxy, undergo a curing process driven by chemical reactions. These reactions result in the creation of covalent bonds among monomers, ultimately forming polymer chains. This curing process is quantified by the parameter known as the 'degree of cure,' denoted as $\\alpha$. Initially, in the absence of any covalent bonds, the material consists solely of individual monomers. In this scenario, it can be asserted that no bonding has occurred, resulting in $\\alpha = 0$. However, upon the addition of a hardener, the monomers initiate the formation of polymer chains through the establishment of covalent bonds. When all the monomers have become part of polymer chains through these covalent bonds, it is deemed that the degree of cure has reached its maximum, $\\alpha = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chemical reactions occur through contact of two active groups belonging to different molecules (for example of epoxy and of a hardener). Elevated cure temperatures are essential to trigger and maintain the chemical reactions responsible for converting the thermoset into a fully cured state. Whenever resin and hardener molecules (after mixing) are provided with more kinetic energy, they are more likely to shift and collide with neighbouring molecules, increasing the chances of curing reactions. Additionally, when more time is given to two reactants, the probability of a necessary collision for bonding increases. As a result, these phenomena are highly influenced by resin chemistry, catalyst reactivity, cure temperature, and the presence of inhibitors or accelerators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Therefore, we can say that the degree of cure $\\alpha$ is a function of both temperature and time. $$\\alpha = f(T,t)$$"

    "#### Cure kinetics is concerned with the rates of the chemical reactions in a curing process. This is relevant, since the cure kinetics can help predict the thermoset cure and therefore also determines the manufacturing process and (partially) the final material properties. When cure kinetics are understood, they can be used to predict the degree of cure $\\alpha$ of a certain process. To make this type of prediction, DSC measurement data can be used."

This process involves the formation of covalent bonds between monomers, ultimately resulting in the creation of the polymer network. The amount of formed bonds, therefore the degree of cross-linking, directly impacts the glass transition temperature ($T_g$) of the material. In the initial stages of the curing cycle, when relatively few bonds or crosslinks have formed, the material exhibits a relatively low $T_g$. However, as the degree of cure increases, the $T_g$ of the material increases. \n",
