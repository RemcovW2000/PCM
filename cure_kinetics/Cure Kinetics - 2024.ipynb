    "    \"### As it was explained during the lectures, a significant part of research in composites manufacturing is involved in analyzing curing processes of thermoset polymers.Thermoset resins, such as epoxy, undergo a curing process driven by chemical reactions. These reactions result in the creation of covalent bonds among monomers, ultimately forming polymer chains. This curing process is quantified by the parameter known as the 'degree of cure,' denoted as $\\\\alpha$. Initially, in the absence of any covalent bonds, the material consists solely of individual monomers. In this scenario, it can be asserted that no bonding has occurred, resulting in $\\\\alpha = 0$. However, upon the addition of a hardener, the monomers initiate the formation of polymer chains through the establishment of covalent bonds. When all the monomers have become part of polymer chains through these covalent bonds, it is deemed that the degree of cure has reached its maximum, $\\\\alpha = 1$\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"### Chemical reactions occur through contact of two active groups belonging to different molecules (for example of epoxy and of a hardener). Elevated cure temperatures are essential to trigger and maintain the chemical reactions responsible for converting the thermoset into a fully cured state. Whenever resin and hardener molecules (after mixing) are provided with more kinetic energy, they are more likely to shift and collide with neighbouring molecules, increasing the chances of curing reactions. Additionally, when more time is given to two reactants, the probability of a necessary collision for bonding increases. As a result, these phenomena are highly influenced by resin chemistry, catalyst reactivity, cure temperature, and the presence of inhibitors or accelerators.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"### Therefore, we can say that the degree of cure $\\\\alpha$ is a function of both temperature and time. $$\\\\alpha = f(T,t)$$\"\n",

    "    \"The curing of a thermoset resin is an exothermic reaction, meaning for any number of curing reactions, there is a set amount of heat that is released. As such the heat flow rate is proportional to the amount of curing reactions taking place (which is the rate of cure), hence the heat flow rate is proportional to the curing rate of the resin.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"At higher temperatures, the curing rate is higher due to the increased molecular mobility of the resin and hardener molecules, increasing the number of reactions created due to inter-molecular collisions. This leads to a higher rate of cure, causing higher spikes in the heat flow rate.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"The peak in the heat flow rate corresponds to the maximum curing rate of the resin. The reason for this peak is the autocatalytic effect of the curing reaction. This also corresponds to the k2 term in the Kamal-Sourour model. As the curing progresses, it catalyses itself. The curing rate goes back down due to the depletion of the unreacted sites in the resin.\"\n",

Introducing more heat into a system enhances molecular mobility increases the system’s kinetic energy, which culminates into more frequent chemical reactions in form of collisions between the resin and hardener molecules. In conclusion, the higher the curing temperature the higher the final degree of cure.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"As the curing reaction progresses, it reduces molecular mobility, as the degree of cure approaches 1,the reaction eventually transitions from a kinetic into a diffusion-dominated reaction. In case the temperature is not high enough to sustain the completion of the curing process, the reaction will come to a halt, hence not fully curing. In view of this, the three isothermals show distinctive outcomes. The 180 °C-isothermal-curve experiences the steepest increase in degree of cure, successfully curing the epoxy compared to the other lower temperature counterparts whose corresponding degree of cure stagnates at values below 1.\\n\",\n",

    "    \"#### As mentioned at the beginning of this Notebook, thermoset polymers undergo a curing cycle to achieve hardening. This process involves the formation of covalent bonds between monomers, ultimately resulting in the creation of the polymer network. The amount of formed bonds, therefore the degree of cross-linking, directly impacts the glass transition temperature ($T_g$) of the material. In the initial stages of the curing cycle, when relatively few bonds or crosslinks have formed, the material exhibits a relatively low $T_g$. However, as the degree of cure increases, the $T_g$ of the material increases. \\n\",\n",

From a microscale point of view, the segmental motion of the polymer chains is significantly restricted, leading to the chains being ‘frozen’ in place. Moreover, the lack of polymer chain mobility adversely affects the chemical reactivity of the material, since reactive groups cannot diffuse and collide effectively. As the isothermal curing process progresses, the polymer chains react with the hardener, successfully crosslinking the material. However, these crosslinks create 3D crosslinked networks which restrict the mobility of the remaining polymer segments which attempt to further create crosslinks in a mission to achieve a complete curing. The progressive restriction leads to the increase of T_g, which imperatively suggests that more heat must be applied to enable a successful molecular motion past the already existing 3D crosslink networks.\",\n",
